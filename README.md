# Wayblue Nvidia Muskoxen &nbsp; [![bluebuild build badge](https://github.com/blue-build/template/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/blue-build/template/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Modified wayblue-niri-nvidia image with noctalia and some other tools

See the [BlueBuild docs](https://blue-build.org/how-to/setup/) for quick setup instructions for setting up your own repository based on this template.

After setup, it is recommended you update this README to describe your custom image.

## Installation

> [!WARNING]  
> This is an image mainly intended for my own personal use. Use at your own risk. If you do try it and notice something is wrong and want to fix it, PRs are welcome, but I don't offer any guarantee that I will merge them or even look at them.

To rebase an existing atomic Fedora installation to the latest build:

- First rebase to the unsigned image, to get the proper signing keys and policies installed:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-unverified-registry:ghcr.io/derfl007/wayblue-nvidia-muskoxen:latest
  ```
- Reboot to complete the rebase:
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```
- Then rebase to the signed image, like so:
  ```
  rpm-ostree rebase ostree-image-signed:docker://ghcr.io/derfl007/wayblue-nvidia-muskoxen:latest
  ```
- Reboot again to complete the installation
  ```
  systemctl reboot
  ```

The `latest` tag will automatically point to the latest build. That build will still always use the Fedora version specified in `recipe.yml`, so you won't get accidentally updated to the next major version.

## Post Installation

Run `ujust setup-noctalia` to automatically create a noctalia niri config file which will be included in your existing niri config.kdl.

Alternatively you can also just change your ~/.config/niri/config.kdl according to the instructions in the [noctalia docs](https://docs.noctalia.dev/v5/compositor-settings/niri/)

## ISO

If build on Fedora Atomic, you can generate an offline ISO with the instructions available [here](https://blue-build.org/how-to/generate-iso/#_top). These ISOs cannot unfortunately be distributed on GitHub for free due to large sizes, so for public projects something else has to be used for hosting.

## Verification

These images are signed with [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/)'s [cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign). You can verify the signature by downloading the `cosign.pub` file from this repo and running the following command:

```bash
cosign verify --key cosign.pub ghcr.io/blue-build/template
```
